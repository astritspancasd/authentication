# Authentication app

Check [demo](https://authentication-r61.netlify.app/)

Have you ever been tired from expired json web tokens? Yeah... me too. Authentication app solves this issue. 
By giving the right instance, username and password, authentication app will fetch jwt for you which will always be fresh and valid. It will also decode json web token for you so you dont need to use something like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/)
