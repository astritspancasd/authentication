# Authentication app

Check [demo](https://authentication-r61.netlify.app/)

Have you ever been tired from testing your expired jwt tokens? Yeah... me too. Authentication app solves this issue. 
By giving the right instance, username and password, authentication app will fetch jwt for you which will always be fresh and valid. It will also decode jwt for you so you dont need to use something like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/)
